	abstract = {Every artificial intelligence system needs big data for training. In particular, artificial intelligence for object detection requires a lot of images for training. It is possible to obtain training images from internet by web crawler. In most cases, however, images collected by the crawler are often not refined. In other words, it can’t be used as training data in any artificial intelligence platform without proper pre-processing. This paper describes a pre-processing system for images collected by a crawler for YOLO training. And it will proved that this system is capable of efficient training.},

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce a fully end-to-end approach for visual tracking in videos that learns to predict the bounding box locations of a target object at every frame. An important insight is that the tracking problem can be considered as a sequential decision-making process and historical semantics encode highly relevant information for future decisions. Based on this intuition, we formulate our model as a recurrent convolutional neural network agent that interacts with a video overtime, and our model can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to learn good tracking policies that pay attention to continuous, inter-frame correlation and maximize tracking performance in the long run. The proposed tracking algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in an existing tracking benchmark and operates at frame-rates faster than realtime. To the best of our knowledge, our tracker is the ﬁrst neural-network tracker that combines convolutional and recurrent networks with RL algorithms.},

	abstract = {We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. Using a novel, multi-scale training method the same YOLOv2 model can run at varying sizes, offering an easy tradeoff between speed and accuracy. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running signiﬁcantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classiﬁcation. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classiﬁcation dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don’t have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it still runs in real-time.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524},
	abstract = {Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30\% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012—achieving a mAP of 53.3\%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning, yields a signiﬁcant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture. We ﬁnd that R-CNN outperforms OverFeat by a large margin on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/˜rbg/rcnn.},

Advances like SPPnet [7] and Fast R-CNN [5] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully-convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. RPNs are trained end-to-end to generate highquality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. With a simple alternating optimization, RPN and Fast R-CNN can be trained to share convolutional features. For the very deep VGG-16 model [19], our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 (73.2\% mAP) and 2012 (70.4\% mAP) using 300 proposals per image.

	abstract = {Several machine learning models, including neural networks, consistently misclassify adversarial examples—inputs formed by applying small but intentionally worst-case perturbations to examples from the dataset, such that the perturbed input results in the model outputting an incorrect answer with high conﬁdence. Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overﬁtting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks’ vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the ﬁrst explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.},

For the periodic pattern of the artifacts, we apply the 2-D FFT on the strain and natural images to extract and remove the peaks which are corresponding to periodic noise in the frequency domain. Further the mean filter applied to get more effective results. The performance of the proposed method is tested on both natural and strain images. The results of proposed method is compared with the mean filter based periodic noise removal and found that the proposed method significantly improved for the noise removal.},

	abstract = {With the emerging technologies and all associated devices, it is predicted that massive amount of data will be created in the next few years – in fact, as much as 90\% of current data were created in the last couple of years – a trend that will continue for the foreseeable future. Sustainable computing studies the process by which computer engineer/scientist designs computers and associated subsystems eﬃciently and effectively with minimal impact on the environment. However, current intelligent machine-learning systems are performance driven – the focus is on the predictive/classiﬁcation accuracy, based on known properties learned from the training samples. For instance, most machine-learning-based nonparametric models are known to require high computational cost in order to ﬁnd the global optima. With the learning task in a large dataset, the number of hidden nodes within the network will therefore increase signiﬁcantly, which eventually leads to an exponential rise in computational complexity. This paper thus reviews the theoretical and experimental data-modeling literature, in large-scale data-intensive ﬁelds, relating to: (1) model eﬃciency, including computational requirements in learning, and dataintensive areas’ structure and design, and introduces (2) new algorithmic approaches with the least memory requirements and processing to minimize computational cost, while maintaining/improving its predictive/classiﬁcation accuracy and stability.},
