	abstract = {We present the properties of different achiral orthogonal polar smectic phases observed in a homologous series of bent-core molecular compounds. The macroscopically uniaxial SmAPR phase transforms to biaxial state by the application of higher electric fields and biaxial SmAPA phase undergoes biaxial-uniaxial-biaxial texture transformation with increasing electric fields, i.e., initial antiferroelectric structure transforms into ferroelectric state under higher electric fields and it shows three different optically distinguishable states. The SmAPAR phase shows an entirely different response compared to other polar smectic phases under study. The dielectric measurements in the SmAPAR phase is the evidence of antiferroelectric behavior of uniaxial state. The polarizing microscopy texture observation supports the corresponding biaxiality measurements.},

We compare our observations with a phenomenological model that includes dipole coupling of the director field to an external ordering field. This model is able to account for both the observed coalescence dynamics and the observed ordering dynamics. In the absence of an ordering field, our model predicts the defect density ρ to scale with time t as ρ lnρ∝t−1. When the dipole coupling of the director field to an external ordering field is included, both the model and experiments show the defect coarsening proceeds as ρ∝e−αt with the strain field confined to 2π walls. The external ordering field most likely arises from the director’s tendency to align with edge dislocations within the liquid-crystal film.},

Critical dynamic scaling is satisfied for quenches to finite temperatures below TKT (the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature).

We then reconstruct correlations from the minimal-energy configuration consistent with the vortex positions, and find them significantly different from the “natural” correlations — though both scale with L. This indicates that both topological (vortex) and nontopological “spin-wave” contributions to correlations are relevant arbitrarily late after the quench. We also present a consistent definition of dynamical scaling applicable more generally, and emphasize how to generalize our approach to other quenched systems where dynamical scaling is in question.

The transition is from a high-symmetry state, where the molecules are perpendicular to the film boundaries (homeotropic alignment), to a lower-symmetry state, where the molecules are inclined (tilted alignment), and occurs as the temperature of the sample is raised. A previous study by Faetti and Fronzoni (1978) discovered a similar transition in freely suspended nematic films of N-(p-methoxybenzylidene)-p-n-butylaniline, except that it occurred as the temperature was lowered, a result that we confirm here. In order to explain both orientational transitions and the temperature-independent alignment of other nematics, we have generalized a model by Parsons (1978) that is based on competition between polar and quadrupolar contributions to the surface free energy. By considering the effects of smectic ordering and ionic impurities, we can account for all of the various observations. (c) 1995 The American Physical Society},

Although long-wavelength fluctuations in the layer displacements destroy translational order at any finite tem-perature, one must also account for effects of free dislocations. The combined action of layer fluctuations and dislocations is to produce a phase at finite temperature with persistent orientational order in the local normal to the layers. At length scales greater than ξD∼exp(ED2kBT) where ED is the energy of an isolated dislocation, the properties are those of a two-dimensional nematic, with the local layer normal playing the role of a director field. An intermediate phase of this kind could conceivably exist in bulk cholesteric liquid crystals as well. In two dimensions, an unbinding of disclination pairs eventually produces an isotropic phase. The low-temperature nematic Frank constants K1(T) and K3(T) are worked out, and compared with the diamagnetic susceptibility expected in a two-dimensional superconductor. We determine the characteristic nematic frequencies at low temperatures, using a simple model of dislocations interacting with a layer displacement field. Our analysis may also be relevant to the behavior of Rayleigh-Benard convective rolls in the presence of thermal noise fluctuations.},

By tracking disclinations during annealing with time-lapse atomic force microscopy, we observe dominant mechanisms of disclination annihilation involving tripoles and quadrupoles (three and four disclinations, respectively). We describe how annihilation events involving multiple disclinations result in similarly reduced kinetic exponents as observed here.

By using Monte Carlo simulations we first determine the time and temperature dependence of the growing correlation length after an infinitely rapid quench from above the transition temperature to the quasi-long-range order region. The functional form is consistent with a logarithmic correction to the diffusive law and it serves to validate dynamic scaling in this problem. This analysis clarifies the different dynamic roles played by bound and free vortices. We then revisit the Kibble–Zurek mechanism in thermal phase transitions in which the disordered state is plagued with topological defects. We provide a theory of quenching rate dependence in systems with the BKT-type transition that goes beyond the equilibrium scaling arguments. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for a host of physical systems with vortex excitations, including planar ferromagnets and liquid crystals.},

However, their fine structures remain elusive because of the microscopic scales involved. In the case of a liquid crystal, optical microscopy, although routinely used for the identification of liquid crystal phases and associated defects, does not have resolution high enough to distinguish fine structures of topological defects. Here we show that polarised and fluorescence microscopy, with the aid of numerical calculations on the orientational order and resulting image distortions, can uncover the structural states of topological defects with strength m =  ±1 in a thin cell of a nematic liquid crystal. Particularly, defects with m = +1 exhibit four different states arising from chiral symmetry breaking and up-down symmetry breaking. Our results demonstrate that optical microscopy is still a powerful tool to identify fine states of liquid crystalline defects.},

The subphases were identified by the electric field dependence of cono- scopic figures and the apparent tilt angle as a function of field strength. Systematically changing the mixing ratio of two properly chosen compounds and studying the stability of each subphase, we have substantiated that the subphases between SmC*A and SmC* form a Devil’s staircase, SmC*A(qT). Here, qT is an irreducible rational number, which specifies a fraction of the ferroelectric ordering in the antiferroelectric ordering.

	abstract = {The Langevin equation for a particle (“random walker”) moving in d-dimensional space under an attractive central force and driven by a Gaussian white noise is considered for the case of a power-law force, F(r)∼−r−σ. The “persistence probability,” P0(t), that the particle has not visited the origin up to time t is calculated for a number of cases. For σ{\textgreater}1, the force is asymptotically irrelevant (with respect to the noise), and the asymptotics of P0(t) are those of a free random walker. For σ{\textless}1, the noise is (dangerously) irrelevant and the asymptotics of P0(t) can be extracted from a weak noise limit within a path-integral formalism employing the Onsager-Machlup functional. The case σ=1, corresponding to a logarithmic potential, is most interesting because the noise is exactly marginal. In this case, P0(t) decays as a power law, P0(t)∼t−θ with an exponent θ that depends continuously on the ratio of the strength of the potential to the strength of the noise. This case, with d=2, is relevant to the annihilation dynamics of a vortex-antivortex pair in the two-dimensional XY model. Although the noise is multiplicative in the latter case, the relevant Langevin equation can be transformed to the standard form discussed in the first part of the paper. The mean annihilation time for a pair initially separated by r is given by t(r)∼r2ln(r/a) where a is a microscopic cutoff (the vortex core size). Implications for the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the system are discussed and compared to numerical simulation results.},

	abstract = {We present a framework for the study of disclinations in two-dimensional active nematic liquid crystals and topological defects in general. The order tensor formalism is used to calculate exact multiparticle solutions of the linearized static equations inside a planar uniformly aligned state so that the total charge has to vanish. Topological charge conservation then requires that there is always an equal number of q=1/2 and q=−1/2 charges. Starting from a set of hydrodynamic equations, we derive a low-dimensional dynamical system for the parameters of the static solutions, which describes the motion of a half-disclination pair or of several pairs. Within this formalism, we model defect production and annihilation, as observed in experiments. Our dynamics also provide an estimate for the critical density at which production and annihilation rates are balanced.},

	abstract = {We investigate the coarsening kinetics of an XY model defined on a square lattice when the underlying dynamics is governed by an energy-conserving Hamiltonian equation of motion. We find that the apparent superdiffusive growth of the length scale can be interpreted as the vortex mobility diverging logarithmically in the size of the vortex–antivortex pair, where the time dependence of the characteristic length scale can be fitted as L ( t ) ∼ (( t + t 0 )ln( t + t 0 )) 1/2 with a finite offset time t 0 . This interpretation is based on a simple phenomenological model of vortex–antivortex annihilation to explain the growth of the coarsening length scale L ( t ). The nonequilibrium spin autocorrelation function A ( t ) and the growing length scale L ( t ) are related by A ( t) ≃ L −λ ( t ) with a distinctive exponent of λ ≃ 2.21 (for E = 0.4) possibly reflecting the strong effect of propagating spin-wave modes. We also investigate the nonequilibrium relaxation (NER) of the system under sudden heating of the system from a perfectly ordered state to the regime of quasi-long-range order, which provides a very accurate estimation of the equilibrium correlation exponent η( E ) for a given energy E . We find that both the equal-time spatial correlation C n r ( r , t ) and the NER autocorrelation A n r ( t ) exhibit scaling features consistent with the dynamic exponent of z n r = 1.},

	abstract = {This paper investigated the dynamics of a dipole of ±1 2 parallel wedge disclination lines in a confined geometry, based on Landau-de Gennes theory. The behavior of the pair depends on the competition between two kinds of forces: the attractive force between the two defects, aggravating the annihilation process, and the anchoring forces coming from the substrates, inhibiting the annihilation process. There are three states when the system is equilibrium, divided by two critical thicknesses dc1 and dc2 (existing when r0 ≤ 15ξ , r0 is the initial distance between the two defects), both changing linearly with r0 . When the cell gap d {\textgreater} dc1 , the two defects coalesce and annihilate. The dynamics follows the function of r ∝ (t0 − t )α during the annihilation step when d is sufficiently large, relative to r0 , where r is the relative distance between the pair and t0 is the coalescence time. α decreases with the decrease of d or the increase of r0 . The annihilation process has delicate structures: when r0 ≤ 15ξ and d {\textgreater} dc2 or r0 {\textgreater} 15ξ and d {\textgreater} dc1 , the two defects annihilate and the system is uniaxial at equilibrium state; when r0 ≤ 15ξ and dc2 ≥ d {\textgreater} dc1 , the two defects coalesce and annihilate, and the system is not uniaxial, but biaxial in the region where the defects collide. When d ≤ dc1 , the defects can be stable existence.},

	abstract = {Due to recent advances in fast iterative solvers in the field of computational fluid dynamics, more complex problems which were previously beyond the scope of standard techniques can be tackled. In this paper, we describe one such situation, namely, modelling the interaction of flow and molecular orientation in a complex fluid such as a liquid crystal. Specifically, we consider a nematic liquid crystal in a spatially inhomogeneous flow situation where the orientational order is described by a second rank alignment tensor. The evolution is determined by two coupled equations: a generalised Navier–Stokes equation for flow in which the divergence of the stress tensor also depends on the alignment tensor and its time derivative, and a convection-diffusion type equation with non-linear terms that stem from a Landau-Ginzburg-DeGennes potential for the alignment. In this paper, we use a specific model with three viscosity coefficients that allows the contribution of the orientation to the viscous stress to be cast in the form of an orientation-dependent force. This effectively decouples the flow and orientation, with each appearing only on the right-hand side of the other equation. In this way, difficulties associated with solving the fully coupled problem are circumvented and a stand-alone fast solver, such as the state-of-the-art preconditioned iterative solver implemented here, can be used for the flow equation. A time-discretised strategy for solving the flow-orientation problem is illustrated using the example of Stokes flow in a lid-driven cavity.},

The approach is particularly suited for the late stages of the annihilation process. It is confirmed that the +1/2 disclination line moves considerably faster than the −1/2 one (e.g., twice as fast) due to the hydrodynamic flow. Symmetries of the important stress tensor terms upon inverting the sign of the winding number and performing a homogeneous in-plane rotation of the Q-tensor eigensystem are discussed.

The phases have varying crystallographic unit periodicity from a few (SmC∗α), four (SmC∗FI2), three (SmC∗FI1), and two (SmC∗A) smectic layers and all of the phases possess liquidlike order inside the layer. The review describes the discovery of these phases and various methods used for their identification and to determine their structures and their properties. A theoretical description of these systems is also given; one of the models—the discrete phenomenological model—of antiferroelectric liquid crystals is discussed in detail as this model allows for an explanation of phase structures and observed phase sequences under changes of temperature or external fields that is most consistent with experimental results.},

In contrast to PIV, in which the mean displacement of a small group of particles is sought for, PTV tracks the trajectories of individual particles in three-dimensional space. Particle identification and determination of its position in space is a very important step in PTV.

	abstract = {For more than one decade, were the only three confirmed commensurate SmC* variant phases with periodicities less than or equal four layers. In 2006, employing ellipsometry and resonant X-ray diffraction (RXRD), our research team first discovered a new liquid crystal mesophase having a six-layer periodicity in one ternary mixture which includes one sulfur-containing compound. From our ellipsometric results, this phase showed antiferroelectric-like optical response. This novel discovery inspired renewed interest to search for liquid crystal mesophases with commensurate periodicities greater than four layers. Soon after, another mesophase having a six-layer structure and showing a ferrielectric-like dielectric response, instead, was uncovered by RXRD measurements on a different binary mixture which has one bromine-containing compound. Meanwhile mesophases having a 5-, 8-, 12- or 15-layer periodicity were reported. However, numerous questions remain to be addressed associated with these unusual reported phases. Theoretical models giving rise to mesophases with periodicities greater than four layers have been developed; but, to date, none of them have provided satisfactory explanations of all the physical phenomena related to the mesophases exhibiting a six-layer structure. Moreover, the question “what is the source of long-range interactions between liquid-like smectic layers, which are responsible for establishing mesophases with long periodicities and mean-field behavior of the smectic-A–smectic-C transition?” remains unanswered for more than three decades.},

	abstract = {The uncertainty quantification of particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements is still an open problem, and to date, no consensus exists about the best suited approach. When the spatial resolution is not appropriate, the largest uncertainties are usually caused by flow gradients. But also the amount of loss-of-pairs due to out-of-plane flow motion and insufficient light-sheet overlap causes strong uncertainties in real experiments. In this paper, we show how the amount of loss-of-pairs can be quantified using the volume of the correlation function normalized by the volume of the autocorrelation function. The findings are an important step toward a reliable uncertainty estimation of instantaneous planar velocity fields computed from PIV and stereo-PIV data. Another important consequence of the analysis is that the results allow for the optimization of PIV and stereo-PIV setups in view of minimizing the total error. In particular, it is shown that the best results (concerning the relative uncertainty) can be achieved if the out-of-plane loss-of-correlation is smaller than one (F o ). The only exception is the case where the out-of-plane motion is exactly zero. The predictions are confirmed experimentally in the last part of the paper.},

This powerful experimental technique utilises “forbidden reflections” to determine the subtle differences in interlayer orientation that differentiate several smectic systems. The technique relies on the materials containing an atom to which the X-ray energy can be tuned, usually sulphur or selenium. Experiments are often carried out on free-standing films that provide a highly monodomain structure that allows high-resolution measurements to be made, and, hence, structural details to be determined. Alternatively, resonant scattering has been demonstrated for materials contained in glass devices that permit the application of electric fields to the system, in a manner analogous to that used in liquid crystal devices. The resonant scattering technique provides unequivocal descriptions of the packing in smectic systems, and the way in which the packing is distorted in electric fields. This Minireview describes the principles behind resonant X-ray scattering, its application to liquid crystals and some of the potential for the future.},

This paper reports resonant scattering features in the antiferroelectric hexatic phase, the three- and four-layer intermediate phases, the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric phases and the SmC*α phase. The helicoidal pitch has been measured from the scattering peaks in the four-layer intermediate phase as well as in the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric phases. In the SmC*α phase, an investigation into the helical structure has revealed a pitch ranging from 5 to 54 layers in different materials. Further, a strong resonant scattering signal has been observed in mixtures of a selenium containing material with as much as 90\% nonresonant material.},

	abstract = {One studying the motion of fluids relative to particulate systems is soon impressed by the dichotomy which exists between books covering theoretical and practical aspects. Classical hydrodynamics is largely concerned with perfect fluids which unfortunately exert no forces on the particles past which they move. Practical approaches to subjects like fluidization, sedimentation, and flow through porous media abound in much useful but uncorrelated empirical information. The present book represents an attempt to bridge this gap by providing at least the beginnings of a rational approach to fluid particle dynamics, based on first principles. From the pedagogic viewpoint it seems worthwhile to show that the Navier-Stokes equations, which form the basis of all systematic texts, can be employed for useful practical applications beyond the elementary problems of laminar flow in pipes and Stokes law for the motion of a single particle. Although a suspension may often be viewed as a continuum for practical purposes, it really consists of a discrete collection of particles immersed in an essentially continuous fluid. Consideration of the actual detailed boundary value problems posed by this viewpoint may serve to call attention to the limitation of idealizations which apply to the overall transport properties of a mixture of fluid and solid particles.},

	abstract = {Thinner parts (the so-called holes) and thicker parts (islands) move in free-standing smectic films due to gravity if the film is inclined. The velocity of the movement depends on the viscosity coefficient η3 of the film. Therefore, this measurement is a direct method to determine η3 in smectic phases. This paper contains the corresponding hydrodynamic calculations for the flow patterns in and around a circular hole in a circular two-dimensional film under various conditions. The viscous force on the hole is calculated. Experiments are performed with the liquid crystal n-octyl-cyano-biphenyl (8CB) in the smectic phase. The influence of the disclination which surrounds the hole and the influence of the gas which surrounds the film on the movement is studied. It is shown that the influence of these effects on the determination of η3 can be neglected if the film is thick and the difference in the thicknesses between film and hole is small. The temperature dependence of η3 is determined for 8CB.},

This system is uniquely suited to the study of unsteady aerodynamics and hydrodynamics, such as avian aerodynamics or bluff-body oscillations. Measurements have been made on an elongated bluff body through the initial build-up phase of flutter. The possibilities to study this instability, which was responsible for the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, are significantly broadened by the use of this system. The long-time recording capability of the system allows for novel results since it yields data that are spatially and temporally resolved over a long record length. The buildup of flutter is shown to exhibit complex dynamics that are heavily influenced by the flow-induced motion of the body. Features of the wake turbulence as a function of time are presented and shown to substantially vary.},

This phase transition is found to be nearly second order with a first-order temperature jump of less than 10 mK. The peak scattering intensity, σ(q⃗ 0), with q⃗ 0=(0, 0, 2πd), where d is the layer spacing, and the longitudinal correlation length, ξ∥, exhibit single power-law divergences for 5×10−5∣∣1−TTc∣∣2×10−2 with critical exponents of γ=1.26±0.06 and ν∥=0.67±0.02, respectively. These exponents agree within the errors with the predicted d=3, n=2 values appropriate to de Gennes' superconductor analogue model. The ratio of the longitudinal to transverse correlation lengths, ξ∥ξ⊥, increases gradually with decreasing reduced temperature, changing by a factor of 2.6 over the above temperature range. This corresponds to an effective exponent difference ∥√−√†=0.16. The bend mode elastic constant K3, which is predicted to have a divergent contribution (kBTq2o24π)2ξ∥, exhibits single power law behavior for 10−4≤1−TTc10−2, with ν∥=0.62±0.03 in reasonable agreement with the x-ray results. The predicted amplitude is, however, wrong by a factor of four. Measurements of B, the layer compressibility coefficient in the smectic-A phase, yield BK1∼(Tc−T)φ with φ=0.26±0.06, in agreement with previous experiments in N-p-cyanobenzylidene-p-octyloxyanilene (CBOOA) and octyloxycyanobenzylidene (80CB), but in marked disagreement with the superconducting analogue model which predicts φ=ν1∥=0.67.},

The flow fields determined from correlated particle motions show excellent agreement with what is expected for the theory of 2D fluids for all our films where 0.6≤h/d≤14.3, with the 2D shear viscosity matching that predicted by Trapeznikov.

In the present work, the laminar velocity profiles of freely suspended flowing soap films are examined theoretically and experimentally. A complete momentum integral analysis is performed including boundary layers developed within the channel on the film as well as beside the film in the air. The theoretical results are compared with the experimental measurements via laser Doppler velocimetry. Reasonable agreements are observed. Although the gravity force speeds up the filmmotion, the acceleration is significantly slowed down, but not completely, by the air friction. The growth of the boundary layers developed on the film is also damped by the air friction so that across the film channel the velocity profile is mostly uniform. Moreover, a saturated boundary layer thickness seemingly exists when the thinning due to acceleration and the thickening due to viscousdiffusion are in balance.},

(ii) The interaction decays with interparticle distance r as 1/r2, faster than in unconfined suspensions but slower than near a single wall. (iii) At large distances, the pair interaction is independent of concentration within the experimental accuracy. The confined suspension thus provides an unusual example of long-range, yet essentially pairwise, correlations even at high concentration. These effects are shown to arise from the two-dimensional dipolar form of the flow induced by single-particle motion.},

More precisely we prove that the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation may be approximated, in a suitable way, by finite dimensional diffusion processes with the diffusion constant related to the viscosity. Asa particular case, when the diffusion constant is zero, the finite dimensional theory reduces to the usual deterministic vortex theory, and the limiting equation reduces to the Euler equation.},

	abstract = {The laminar ﬂow through an axisymmetric sudden expansion was investigated experimentally using real-time digital particle image velocimetry. An expansion ratio (downstream-to-upstream pipe diameter ratio) of 2 was selected for the study. The measurements covered the regions of separation, reattachment and re-development. Two dimensional velocity maps were obtained on the vertical center plane for six Reynolds numbers between 20 and 211, based on the upstream pipe diameter and bulk velocity. The stream function distributions are calculated and presented from the streamwise and radial velocity maps. The dependence of reattachment length, redevelopment length and recirculating ﬂow strength on the Reynolds number are determined. Results show that not only the reattachment length but also the redevelopment length downstream of reattachment is a linear function of the Reynolds number. The recirculation eddy strength, on the other hand, has a non-linear dependence on the Reynolds number which becomes weaker as the Reynolds number is increased. The results indicate no instability- or buoyancydriven ﬂow asymmetry in the range 20- Re- 211.},

	abstract = {Low Reynolds number planar hydrodynamic and MHD flow of an incompressible fluid through a 2-D symmetric sudden expansion is numerically studied in the present work with specific attention to the bifurcation characteristics. Hydrodynamic (non-MHD) flow is first considered. The effect of a homogeneous stream-wise magnetic field on the transition characteristics is then studied under the Quasi-static approximation of Magnetohydrodynamics, applicable, when the induced magnetic field is neglected. The Reynolds number of the flows is limited to Re≤100 and selected values of the Interaction parameter (N) measuring the relative strength of the Lorentz force over the inertia in the range N ∈ [0,100] are considered. The temporal growth rate of the transverse velocity component at the location of the first (steady-state) maximum along the symmetry-line is shown to be a more informative and a more easily obtainable measure of asymmetry over other steady-state measures usually used in the literature. This growth rate is found to be independent of the symmetric initial conditions used for the computation and can be exploited in faster evaluation of the critical Reynolds number for the symmetric to asymmetric flow transition. An increase in the strength of the applied magnetic field N is found to have a stabilizing influence in general, reducing the growth rates of asymmetry. The (two equally sized) recirculation zone lengths of the steady-state symmetric solution are found to scale linearly with the Reynolds number (Re) for a fixed strength of the applied magnetic field and directly proportional to ReN and N for Re{\textless}{\textless}N and Re{\textgreater}{\textgreater}N cases respectively.},

The biaxial polar packing of bent molecules in the SmAP A phase is considered to arise from the hindered rotation around the molecular long axis due to the expansion of the mesophase temperatures to a lower temperature region.

	abstract = {Hydrodynamic interactions play an important role in biological processes in cellular membranes, a large separation of length scales often allowing such membranes to be treated as continuous, two-dimensional (2D) fluids. We study experimentally and theoretically the hydrodynamic interaction of pairs of inclusions in two-dimensional, fluid smectic liquid crystal films suspended in air. Such smectic membranes are ideal systems for performing controlled experiments as they are mechanically stable, of highly uniform structure, and have well-defined, variable thickness, enabling experimental investigation of the crossover from 2D to 3D hydrodynamics. Our theoretical model generalizes the Levine-MacKintosh theory of point-force response functions and uses a boundary-element approach to calculate the mobility matrix for inclusions of finite extent.

	abstract = {We report the effect of dispersion of barium titanate (BaTiO 3 ) nanoparticles (BNPs) in a four ring bent core nematic (BCN) liquid crystal. Polarizing optical microscopy reveals the presence of a single nematic phase in pure and doped states. Polar switching has been observed in the bent core system and the value of spontaneous polarization ( P s ) increases with increase in doping concentration of BNPs in BCN. Dielectric study shows a lower frequency mode, which can be ascribed to the formation of cybotactic clusters. These clusters are also responsible for the observed polar switching in pure, as well as, in doped BCNs. Another higher frequency mode, observed only in pure BCN, indicates the rotation of molecules about their long molecular axis. The conductivity of doped samples is also found to decrease as compared to the pure BCN. This reduction helps in the minimization of negative effects caused by free ions in liquid crystal based devices. This study demonstrates that the interaction between BNPs and BCN molecules improves the P s , dielectric behaviour, viscosity and reduces the conductivity of pure BCN. Hence, nanodoping in a BCN is an effective method for the enhancement of electro-optic performances and will lead to the development of faster electro-optic devices.},

The X 1 phase is formed upon cooling from the well-known B 2 phase, and then its characteristic modulated structure is retained at room temperature. A transmission electron microscopic (TEM) observation was performed for shadowed replica film which imprints the surface structure of the homeotropically aligned X 1 phase. The modulation was detected as clear stripes with periodicities ranging from 15 to 18 nm, which agree with the modulation length determined by X-ray measurement. The results confirm that the periodicity along the layer is not due to the simple density modulation occurring within a smooth layer, but can be explained by the layer undulation that creates the crests and troughs.},

It is shown that the anisotropy of the elastic constants that govern layer bending in smectic-C liquid crystals results in an effective long-range interaction between the smectic layers. The nature of this interaction is such as to favor a mutual alignment of the c directors of the layers in either a parallel or antiparallel orientation. The free energy of the system is the sum of the contributions of these long-range interlayer interactions and the short-range interaction between nearest-neighboring layers, which favors a purely helical structure for the c directors. The long-range interaction is found to favor commensurate structures while the short-range term favors incommensurate helices. The resulting structure is of the type characterized in the “distorted clock model.” The phase diagrams that result from the application of this theory are consistent with the experimentally observed phase sequences.},

We study a model that incorporates thermal fluctuations in the flexing of layers and find that it supports commensurate and incommensurate structures. The vibrational entropy competes with an assumed helical interaction between nearest-neighbor layers. An increase in temperature then leads to an unwinding of the helix that proceeds at first through commensurate phases and then into an incommensurate phase.

The quality of the dark state when the sample was inserted between two crossed polarizers was found to be superb and it did not change when rotating the sample between the polarizers. The coupling between the net molecular dipole moment and the applied dc electric field was considered as the origin of the out-of-plane switching of the BC molecules resulting in switching from the field-off bright state to the field-on dark state. The field-induced optically isotropic state is an unambiguous proof of the field-induced biaxiality in the BC nematic liquid crystal.

Particular attention is paid to differentiate it from conventional ferroelectric LCs such as the smectic-C*-type and bent-core LCs from the symmetry point of view. After reviewing ferroelectric smectic LCs (FSLCs), a ferroelectric columnar LC (FCLC) is introduced as a unique ferroelectric LC. FSLCs have a polarization parallel to the layer plane and have arbitrariness in the polarization direction within the two-dimensional plane. Hence surface constraints are generally indispensable for fixing the polarization direction. In contrast, FCLC has an Ising polarization along the column axis, which is very stable once poling is performed and convertible by applying an opposite electric field. In this sense, FCLC is the first genuine ferroelectric LC. Poling and switching can be achieved using spin-coated FCLC films with an open surface as well as conventional sandwich cells. Hence the FCLCs are more suitable for applications such as piezoelectric devices and ultrahigh-density memory devices, whereas only an application to fast display devices is proposed for FSLCs.},

The theoretical model shows that in the case of a simple heliconical nematic structure, two resonant signals corresponding to the full and half pitch band should be present, while only the full pitch band is observed experimentally. This suggests that the twist-bend nematic phase has a complex structure with a double-helix built of two interlocked, shifted helices. We confirm that the helical pitch in the twist-bend nematic phase is in a 10 nm range for both the chiral and achiral materials. We also show that the symmetry of the blue phase can be unambiguously determined through a resonant enhancement of the X-ray diffraction signals, by including polarization effects, which are found to be an important indicator in phase structure determination.},

We have probed the hydrodynamics of thin fluid membranes by active microrheology using small tracer particles to observe the highly anisotropic flow fields generated around a rigid oscillating post inserted into a freely suspended smectic liquid crystal film that is surrounded by air. In general, at distances more than a few Saffman lengths from the meniscus around the post, the measured velocities are larger than the flow computed by modeling a moving disklike inclusion of finite extent by superposing Levine-MacKintosh response functions for pointlike inclusions in a viscous membrane. The observed discrepancy is attributed to additional coupling of the film with the air below the film that is displaced directly by the shaft of the moving post.},

Moreover, the feedback provided by integrating microflow sensors to micro mass flow controllers is essential to deliver accurately set target small flows.

Accurate sensing of gaseous or aqueous environments, chemical vapors, and biomolecules have been demonstrated using a variety of these devices that undergo static deflections or shifts in resonant frequency upon analyte binding. In particular, biological detection of viruses, antigens, DNA, and other proteins is of great interest. While the majority of currently used detection schemes are reliant on biomarkers, such as fluorescent labels, time, effort, and chemical activity could be saved by developing an ultrasensitive method of label-free mass detection. Micro- and nanoscale sensors have been effectively applied as label-free detectors. In the following, we review the technologies and recent developments in the field of micro- and nanoelectromechanical sensors with particular emphasis on their application as biological sensors and recent work towards integrating these sensors in microfluidic systems.},

Two thin plates mounted at an angle are deflected when they are subjected to fluid flow. By combining the mechanical lift force sensor and a thermal hot-chip sensor we now have obtained a sensor capable of high sensitivity in both high and low flows. Both the thermal and the non-thermal parts of the flow sensor have non-linear flow dependencies leading to a flow dependent sensitivity where the hot-chip part has its highest sensitivity for low flows and the lift force part has its highest sensitivity for high flows. When connected in an acceleration insensitive bridge configuration, the lift force sensor is basically insensitive to the direction of the flow but combined with a dual hot-chip configuration, bi-directionality has been accomplished. Here this has been shown by measuring the magnitude using the mechanical lift force principle and using a dual hot-chip configuration for direction detection. This is demonstrated in a simulated ventilator measurement.},

	abstract = {The micromechanical equivalent of a differential pressure flow-sensor, well known in macro mechanics, is discussed. Two separate pressure sensors are used for the device, enabling to measure both, pressure as well as volume flow-rate. An integrated sensor with capacitive read-out as well as a hybrid, piezo-resistive variant is made. The fabrication processes are described, using silicon and glass processing techniques. Based on the sensor layout, equations are derived to describe the sensor behavior both statically as well as dynamically. With the derived equations, the working range of the sensor and the thermal and time stability is estimated. The computed results of the stationary behavior are verified with the measured data. A good similarity in linearity of the pressure/flow relation is found. The computed hydraulic resistance, however, differs from the measured value for water with 21\%. This difference can be explained by the high sensitivity of the resistance to the resistor channel cross-section parameter in combination with the difference between the rounded etched shape and the rectangular approximation. From fluid dynamics simulations, a working range bandwidth of about 1 kHz is expected. Thermal influences on the sensor signal due to viscosity changes are in the order of 2\% flow signal variation per Kelvin. From these results, it can be concluded that the sensor can be used as a low cost, low power consuming flow and pressure-sensing device, for clean fluids without particles and without the tendency to coat the channel walls. If a high accuracy is wanted, an accurate temperature sensing or controlling system is needed.},

The designed sensor needs only one heater to operate the flow sensor, so the detection of flow direction and velocity can be accomplished in small dimension and low power consumption. A silicon diaphragm was formed on the back of the sensors to minimize the heat conduction effect and heat capacity. Furthermore, a gap between a heater and four detectors was formed to optimize heat transfer. In order to evaluate the gap effect, a differently structured sensor was designed and fabricated, and their properties were compared. From the tests results of the two designs, the sensitivity of the sensor, which has a gap, is two times more sensitive than the other sensor, which has no gap. Therefore, it can be concluded that the gap between a heater and four detectors is effective for reducing conduction effect. The test results of the designed sensor show the maximum angle difference was 5° and the velocity error was no more than 0.5m/s.

In the first part of the work, the main heat transfer mechanisms are detailed by qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The 1D model is derived from the heat rate balance of the region we are interested in. In the second part of the work, we compare the data obtained by simulating the 1D model with the experimental data. Also, some full 3D simulations of the fluid flow and heat transfer are made using a commercial software package. Part of these numerical results are compared with the corresponding experimental data. The modeling errors are discussed for both sets of comparisons. Finally, we comment the merits of the 1D model versus the 3D approach. The results obtained herein might be directly used for various thermally based actuators and sensors for flow control and measurement both in micro and macro world.},

	abstract = {Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices integrate various mechanical elements, sensors, actuators, and electronics on a single silicon substrate in order to accomplish a multitude of different tasks in a diverse range of fields. The potential for device miniaturization made possible by MEMS micro-fabrication techniques has facilitated the development of many new applications, such as highly compact, non-invasive pressure sensors, accelerometers, gas sensors, etc. Besides their small physical footprint, such devices possess many other advantages compared to their macro-scale counterparts, including greater precision, lower power consumption, more rapid response, and the potential for low-cost batch production. One area in which MEMS technology has attracted particular attention is that of flow measurement. Broadly speaking, existing micro-flow sensors can be categorized as either thermal or non-thermal, depending upon their mode of operation. This paper commences by providing a high level overview of the MEMS field and then describes some of the fundamental thermal and non-thermal micro-flow sensors presented in the literature over the past 30 years or so.},

	abstract = {We investigated the fabrication, integration and resulting characteristics of a thermal flow sensor on flexible substrates with functional layers (heater, thermopiles for temperature measurement) being located on a membrane. The sensor was fabricated by realizing all high temperature deposition and structuring processes on a silicon wafer first followed by a transfer of the functional layers onto a flexible polyimide substrate. An integration of the sensor by flip chip soldering and conductive adhesives has successfully been demonstrated. The flexible flow sensor presented here is a further development of a standard membrane-based thermal flow sensor using silicon substrate with similar design of the functional layers. Thus, it has given us the chance to make a direct comparison between a flexible and non-flexible approach. The sensors’ characteristics have been experimentally evaluated in terms of response to fluid flow, response time and minimum detectable flow rate and compared with an existing similar silicon-based design. It has turned out that the membrane-based flexible flow sensors integrated by soldering showed expected characteristics of a calorimetric flow sensor. A second – not membrane-based – flexible flow sensor approach being integrated by conductive adhesives showed differences in the response to fluid flow which can be explained by the changed heat distribution. Sensitivities (at zero flow) being measured have values between 0.51mV/m/s (soldered) and 20.1mV/m/s (bonded by adhesives) compared to 30.4mV/m/s (silicon substrate). Finally, an application is presented showing the successful integration of the flexible flow sensor on an airfoil without restricting its structural health. A wind tunnel measurement has been done demonstrating capability of the flexible flow sensor concept for detection of boundary layer separation and reattachment on the overflowed surface.},

Using external acoustic fields they are able to set the surrounding fluid into motion, erode surfaces and even to carry particles attached to their interfaces. Although the acoustic streaming flow that the bubble generates in its vicinity has been often observed, it has never been measured and quantitatively compared with the available theoretical models. The scarcity of quantitative data is partially due to the strong three-dimensional character of bubble-induced streaming flows, which demands advanced velocimetry techniques. In this work, we present quantitative measurements of the flow generated by single and pairs of acoustically excited sessile microbubbles using a three-dimensional particle tracking technique. Using this novel experimental approach we are able to obtain the bubble’s resonant oscillating frequency, study the boundaries of the linear oscillation regime, give predictions on the flow strength and the shear in the surrounding surface and study the flow and the stability of a two-bubble system. Our results show that velocimetry techniques are a suitable tool to make diagnostics on the dynamics of acoustically excited microbubbles.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the detection of individual particle images and their tracking over time to determine the local flow velocity has become quite popular for planar and volumetric measurements. Particle tracking velocimetry has strong advantages compared to the statistical analysis of an ensemble of particle images by means of cross-correlation approaches, such as particle image velocimetry. Tracking individual particles does not suffer from spatial averaging and therefore bias errors can be avoided. Furthermore, the spatial resolution can be increased up to the sub-pixel level for mean fields. A maximization of the spatial resolution for instantaneous measurements requires high seeding concentrations. However, it is still challenging to track particles at high seeding concentrations, if no time series is available. Tracking methods used under these conditions are typically very complex iterative algorithms, which require expert knowledge due to the large number of adjustable parameters. To overcome these drawbacks, a new non-iterative tracking approach is introduced in this letter, which automatically analyzes the motion of the neighboring particles without requiring to specify any parameters, except for the displacement limits. This makes the algorithm very user friendly and also offers unexperienced users to use and implement particle tracking. In addition, the algorithm enables measurements of high speed flows using standard double-pulse equipment and estimates the flow velocity reliably even at large particle image densities.},

	abstract = {This work analyzes the spatial resolution that can be achieved by digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) as a function of the tracer particles and the imaging and recording system. As the in-plane resolution for window-correlation evaluation is related by the interrogation window size, it was assumed in the past that single-pixel ensemble-correlation increases the spatial resolution up to the pixel limit. However, it is shown that the determining factor limiting the resolution of single-pixel ensemble-correlation are the size of the particle images, which is dependent on the size of the particles, the magnification, the f-number of the imaging system, and the optical aberrations. Furthermore, since the minimum detectable particle image size is determined by the pixel size of the camera sensor in DPIV, this quantity is also considered in this analysis. It is shown that the optimal magnification that results in the best possible spatial resolution can be estimated from the particle size, the lens properties, and the pixel size of the camera. Thus, the information provided in this paper allows for the optimization of the camera and objective lens choices as well as the working distance for a given setup. Furthermore, the possibility of increasing the spatial resolution by means of particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) is discussed in detail. It is shown that this technique allows to increase the spatial resolution to the subpixel limit for averaged flow fields. In addition, PTV evaluation methods do not show bias errors that are typical for correlation-based approaches. Therefore, this technique is best suited for the estimation of velocity profiles.},

	abstract = {Liquid crystals are soft materials that combine the ﬂuidity of disordered liquids and the long range orientational or positional order of crystalline solids along one or two directions of space. X-ray scattering is widely and generally successfully used to investigate and characterize the microscopic structure of most liquid crystals. In many cases however, the Bragg reﬂections are forbidden by special symmetries of the unit cell and the low dimensional structure of the liquid crystalline phases are out of reach of conventional X-ray experiments. We show in this paper that this problem can be overcome by resonant scattering of X-rays as it reveals the anisotropy of the tensor structure factor. We review various examples in which the restored forbidden reﬂections reveal unambiguously the hidden structure of liquid crystalline phases. Moreover, we show that in some cases, a ﬁne analysis of the polarization of the Bragg reﬂections enables one to discriminate between diﬀerent structural models. These studies solved long standing questions about biaxial liquid crystal structures and provided new insights into physical phenomena such as supercritical behaviour or commensurate-incommensurate transitions.},

	abstract = {Symmetry-breaking phase transitions are often accompanied by the formation of topological defects, as in cosmological theories of the early universe, superfluids, liquid crystals or solid-state systems. This scenario is described by the Kibble–Zurek mechanism, which predicts corresponding scaling laws for the defect density ρ. One such scaling law suggests a relation ρ≈τQ−1/2 with τQ the change of rate of a control parameter. In contrast to the scaling of the defect density during annihilation with ρ≈t−1, which is governed by the attraction of defects of the same strength but opposite sign, the defect formation process, which depends on the rate of change of a physical quantity initiating the transition, has only rarely been investigated. Herein, we use nematic liquid crystals as a different system to demonstrate the validity of the predicted scaling relation for defect formation. It is found that the scaling exponent is independent of temperature and material employed, thus universal, as predicted.},

The apolar director n b corresponding to the bow axes of the bent-core molecules aligns along the rubbing direction in the stripes with the wave vector of the pattern making a finite angle ω 0 with n b . The novel stripe pattern is extremely soft , as evidenced by the occurrence of isolated lattice disclinations , whose nature is dictated by ω 0 . We argue that the stripes owe their origin to the underlying spatial modulation of surface charges generated on the glass plates by the rubbing action. Though the stripe structure is surface-induced the stripe spacing decreases with increase of sample thickness. Our calculations indicate that the novel origin also leads to the counter intuitive dependence of the stripe spacing on sample thickness.},

The apolar director n b corresponding to the bow axes of the bent-core molecules aligns along the rubbing direction in the stripes with the wave vector of the pattern making a finite angle ω 0 with n b . The novel stripe pattern is extremely soft , as evidenced by the occurrence of isolated lattice disclinations , whose nature is dictated by ω 0 . We argue that the stripes owe their origin to the underlying spatial modulation of surface charges generated on the glass plates by the rubbing action. Though the stripe structure is surface-induced the stripe spacing decreases with increase of sample thickness. Our calculations indicate that the novel origin also leads to the counter intuitive dependence of the stripe spacing on sample thickness.},

The smectic potential has maxima near the plates, which leads to an inward longitudinal pressure unlike in nematic.

	abstract = {Packing Bananas and Boomerangs
Assembling achiral molecules typically generates achiral domains. However, odd things can happen when the molecules are banana-or boomerang-shaped—their cores can twist out of plain to form left- or right-handed helices, which can then pack into chiral domains that will polarize light (see the Perspective by Amabilino). Hough et al. (p. 452) show that if you make the situation even more complex by frustrating the packing of adjacent layers, you can create a material that appears to be macroscopically isotropic with only very local positional and orientational ordering of the molecules but still shows an overall chirality. In a second paper, Hough et al. (p. 456) also show that if you change the chemistry of the molecules to allow for better overall packing, you can create a situation where helical filaments form that also tend to pack in layered structures. However, the frustration between the two types of packing leads to macroscopically chiral and mesoporous structures.
A variety of simple bent-core molecules exhibit smectic liquid crystal phases of planar fluid layers that are spontaneously both polar and chiral in the absence of crystalline order. We found that because of intralayer structural mismatch, such layers are also only marginally stable against spontaneous saddle splay deformation, which is incompatible with long-range order. This results in macroscopically isotropic fluids that possess only short-range orientational and positional order, in which the only macroscopically broken symmetry is chirality—even though the phases are formed from achiral molecules. Their conglomerate domains exhibit optical rotatory powers comparable to the highest ever found for isotropic fluids of chiral molecules.
Banana-shaped molecules lacking handedness form a macroscopically isotropic fluid that still has overall chirality.

The minimization of this free energy is obtained through a combination of analytical and numerical methods. It leads to a phase diagram built in the (α,η) plane where α is local angular parameter and η describes the variation of the temperature. From this graphical representation, many experimentally observed phase sequences of ferroelectric liquid crystals can be explained, even them including subphases which were recently observed like the SmC5⁎ and the SmC6⁎ ones. However, it should be emphasized that the details of predicted phase diagram are strongly dependent on the compound studied.},

The model assumes a bilayer smectic ordering and a mechanism consisting of an azimuthal reorientation of the molecules at the transitions. Three helicoïdal ferrielectric structures are found to be possibly stable, in which the helical pitch is shown to vary monotonically as a function of temperature. One of these phases, characterized by an azimuthal mode independent from the z coordinate, provides a suitable interpretation of the presently known results on ferrielectric ordering in liquid crystals.

The orientational distribution within macroscopic volumes, determined through wide-angle x-ray scattering and birefringence measurements, was found to be identical in the Sm−A* and helical Sm−C* phases. Together with the absence of layer shrinkage, this constitutes strong evidence that the second-order Sm−A*–Sm−C* transition in this material is well described by the diffuse cone model of de Vries. The absolute values of the layer spacing show that the molecules aggregate to antiparallel pairs. The molecular interaction across the layer boundaries will then occur only between fluorine atoms, leading to unusually weak interlayer tilt direction correlation. This explains the experimental observations of a very easily disturbed Sm−C* helix and a peculiar surface-stabilized texture. Tilt angle and birefringence values as a function of field and temperature have been evaluated in the Sm−A* and Sm−C* phases and the results corroborate the conclusions from the x-ray investigations.},

Recent x-ray scattering experiments suggest that, in a class of siloxane-containing liquid crystals, an electric field changes a state of disordered molecular tilt in random directions into a state of ordered tilt in one direction. To investigate this issue, we measure the optical tilt and birefringence of these liquid crystals as functions of field and temperature, and we develop a theory for the distribution of molecular orientations under a field. A comparison of theory and experiment confirms that these materials have a disordered distribution of molecular tilt directions that is aligned by an electric field, giving a large electroclinic effect. It also shows that the effective dipole moment, a key parameter in the theory, scales as a power law near the smectic-A–smectic-C transition.},

This paper reports resonant scattering features in the antiferroelectric hexatic phase, the three- and four-layer intermediate phases, the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric phases and the SmC*α phase. The helicoidal pitch has been measured from the scattering peaks in the four-layer intermediate phase as well as in the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric phases. In the SmC*α phase, an investigation into the helical structure has revealed a pitch ranging from 5 to 54 layers in different materials.

This powerful experimental technique utilises “forbidden reflections” to determine the subtle differences in interlayer orientation that differentiate several smectic systems. The technique relies on the materials containing an atom to which the X-ray energy can be tuned, usually sulphur or selenium. Experiments are often carried out on free-standing films that provide a highly monodomain structure that allows high-resolution measurements to be made, and, hence, structural details to be determined. Alternatively, resonant scattering has been demonstrated for materials contained in glass devices that permit the application of electric fields to the system, in a manner analogous to that used in liquid crystal devices. The resonant scattering technique provides unequivocal descriptions of the packing in smectic systems, and the way in which the packing is distorted in electric fields. This Minireview describes the principles behind resonant X-ray scattering, its application to liquid crystals and some of the potential for the future.},

In this review, we present various efforts that take advantage of novel microscale flow phenomena and microfabrication techniques to build microfluidic cell analysis systems.},

In multiphase flow in micro- and nanochannels several immiscible fluids will be separated from each other by flexible fluidic interfaces. The multiphase coexistence and the small-volume confinement provide many attractive characteristics. Multiphase flow in microfluidic systems shows a complicated behavior but has many practical uses compared to a single-phase flow. In this paper, we discuss the methods of controlling multiphase flow to generate either micro- or nano-droplets (or bubbles) or stable stratified interfaces between fluidic phases. Furthermore, applications of the droplets and interfaces in microchannels are summarized.},

The detection system integrates a pair of external optical fibers and other optical components for particle counting, sizing and fluorescence analysis in each measurement simultaneously. The scattered light signal indicates the total number and the size of the particles passing through the detection window, whereas the concurrent backward fluorescence signal shows only the number of fluorescence particles. In the experiments, microparticles of four different sizes with diameters ranging from 3.2 to 10.2 µm were discriminated and counted based on the fluorescence and scattered light intensity. The relative percentage of the fluorescence-labeled particles can be analyzed by the ratio of the events of fluorescence signals to forward scattered signals.},

	abstract = {In a previous paper we presented a way to measure the rheological properties of complex fluids on a microfluidic chip (Guillot et al., Langmuir 22:6438, 2006). The principle of our method is to use parallel flows between two immiscible fluids as a pressure sensor. In fact, in a such flow, both fluids flow side by side and the size occupied by each fluid stream depends only on both flow rates and on both viscosities. We use this property to measure the viscosity of one fluid knowing the viscosity of the other one, both flow rates and the relative size of both streams in a cross-section. We showed that using a less viscous fluid as a reference fluid allows to define a mean shear rate with a low standard deviation in the other fluid. This method allows us to measure the flow curve of a fluid with less than 250 μL of fluid. In this paper we implement this principle in a fully automated set up which controls the flow rate, analyzes the picture and calculates the mean shear rate and the viscosity of the studied fluid. We present results obtained for Newtonian fluids and complex fluids using this set up and we compare our data with cone and plate rheometer measurements. By adding a mixing stage in the fluidic network we show how this set up can be used to characterize in a continuous way the evolution of the rheological properties as a function of the formulation composition. We illustrate this by measuring the rheological curve of four formulations of polyethylene oxide solution with only 1.3 mL of concentrated polyethylene oxide solution. This method could be very useful in screening processes where the viscosity range and the behavior of the fluid to an applied stress must be evaluated.},

Optics setup was built on an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX71, Olympus, USA) and microchips were made of PDMS using soft lithography. Perfectly aligned axial illumination setup of the commercial microscope ensures effective signal detection. Hydrodynamic flow manipulation scheme is adopted for both flow focusing and cell sorting. Fast and robust sorting function is utilized by a nozzle flow from wide actuation channel. The sorting function is verified through real-time high-speed imaging. The captured images are used for adjusting delays between signal detection and sorting activation. The system automatically adjusts itself to any flow conditions, and so no adjustment is made to the flow parameters between runs. We believe that the proposed techniques will help breaking through the obstacles of μFACS system development.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a disposable flow cytometer that uses an air-liquid two-phase microfluidic system to produce a focused high-speed liquid sample stream of particles and cells. The susceptibility of thin liquid columns to instabilities may suggest that focusing of sample liquids with streams of air would be difficult. The design of channel geometry, control of flow rates, and use of appropriate surface chemistries on the channel walls, however, enabled the generation of thin (15–100 μm) and partially bounded sample streams that were stable and suitable for rapid cell analysis. Using an inverted epi-fluorescence microscope with a photo-multiplier tube, we demonstrated that the system is capable of counting the number of beads and C2C12 myoblast cells. The effects of different flow rates and surface chemistries of the channel walls on the air-liquid two-phase flows were characterized using optical and confocal microscopy. Use of air instead of liquids as a sheath fluid eliminates the need for large sheath liquid reservoirs, and reduces the volume and weight requirements. The low manufacturing cost and high volumetric efficiency make the air-sheath flow cytometer attractive for use as a stand-alone device or as an integrated component of bio-artificial hybrid microsystems.},

	abstract = {Interest in the smectic liquid-crystalline state of matter received a substantial boost with the discovery by Meyer in the mid-1970s that a chiral smectic C (SmC*) phase exhibits a spontaneous electric polarization, and with the subsequent demonstration by Clark and Lagerwall of the surface-stabilized SmC* ferroelectric liquid crystal at the beginning of the 1980s. Since then, chiral smectic phases and their plethora of polar effects have dominated the research in this field, which today has reached a mature state where the first commercial microdisplay applications are now shipping in millions-per-year quantities. In this Review we discuss some of the topics of highest interest in current smectic liquid crystal research, and address application-relevant research (de Vries-type tilting transitions without defect generation and high-tilt antiferroelectric liquid crystals with perfect dark state) as well as more curiosity-driven research (the nature and origin of the chiral smectic C subphases and their intermediate frustrated states between ferro- and antiferroelectricity).},

We have developed a simple theoretical model to describe the observed properties of the SmAPR phase and the transition from the SmAPR to the SmAPA phase. We propose that the above characteristic properties of the SmAPR phase arise due to the strong coupling between the transverse polarisation and the transverse polar order of the bend directions of the bent-core molecules in the layers.},

The bulk domains are situated between layers of synclinic ferroelectric phase near the upper and lower surfaces. In the surface layers induced by polar anchoring domains of opposite chirality are separated by defect lines. Under the electric field the ferroelectric layer near one sample surface is growing against the antiferroelectric structure in the sample bulk and the stripe texture is fading out, but still in the saturated field surface lines or walls persist separating ferroelectric domains of opposite chirality. The proposed model is adapted also for a case when the anticlinic antiferroelectric structure in the sample bulk is sandwiched between anticlinic ferroelectric layers near the surfaces. In that case the applied electric field eliminates all the lines because the resulting anticlinic ferroelectric structure is racemic, with no chiral domains.},

I exactly solve the hydrodynamic equations of the system composed by the liquid layer and the surrounding fluid in order to evaluate the correlation function of the thermally excited velocity fluctuations. Both the temporal and the spatial statistical properties are the ones of a two dimensional, hypotetical fluid, only for temporal and spatial frequencies higher than critical values; at lower frequencies they show significative deviations due to the interactions of the liquid layer with the surrounding fluid.},

	abstract = {We study the contribution of advection by thermal velocity fluctuations to the effective diffusion coefficient in a mixture of two identical fluids. The steady-state diffusive flux in a finite system subject to a concentration gradient is enhanced because of long-range correlations between concentration fluctuations and fluctuations of the velocity parallel to the concentration gradient. The enhancement of the diffusive transport depends on the system size L and grows as ln( L / L 0 ) in quasi-two-dimensional systems, while in three dimensions it grows as L 0 − 1 − L − 1 , where L 0 is a reference length. The predictions of a simple fluctuating hydrodynamics theory, closely related to second-order mode–mode coupling analysis, are compared to results from particle simulations and a finite-volume solver and excellent agreement is observed. We elucidate the direct connection to the long-time tail of the velocity autocorrelation function in finite systems, as well as finite-size corrections employed in molecular dynamics calculations. Our results conclusively demonstrate that the nonlinear advective terms need to be retained in the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics when modeling transport in small-scale finite systems.},

	abstract = {Experimental work has shown that non-equilibrium concentration fluctuations arise during free diffusion in fluids and theoretical analysis has been carried on. The results show that, in usual three-dimensional fluids, the phenomenon is extremely weak, in terms of amplitude of the fluctuations and of corrugation of the diffusion wave fronts. In this paper, we show that the phenomena strongly depends on the dimensionality of the system: by extending the theory to two dimensional systems, we show that the root mean square amplitude of the fluctuations and the wave front corrugation become much stronger. We also present an evaluation of the Hausdorf dimension of the expected fluctuations. Experimentally, two-dimensional liquid systems can be realised as freely suspended liquid films; experiments and theoretical works on diffusion in such systems showed that the dynamics is deeply affected by the viscous drag exerted by the fluids (e.g. air) surrounding the film. We provide an evaluation of the drag on the fluctuations. In particular, we study the case of a concentration profile that is initially gaussian: it can be directly compared with the results from a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiment. We propose that this theory and the related experiments can be relevant for describing the diffusion along the cellular membranes of living organisms.},

Recently it was proposed that the planes of the molecules are tilted with respect to the smectic layers and the structure is chiral. The ground state is antiferroelectric and the majority of the films are racemic with the same tilt direction in the subsequent layers. Basically the tilt directions are equivalent, and stripes with oppositely tilted molecules exist. In this paper we show that it is possible to suppress the formation of the stripes, and to obtain a uniform texture in thin films. In uniform racemic textures, weak quadratic electro-optical switching can be observed. Voltage dependences of the switching are measured and the switching mechanisms are discussed.},

Spontaneous polarisations, rotational viscosities, relaxation frequencies, dielectric strengths and distribution parameters were determined as a function of temperature. The electric field required for saturation of the spontaneous polarisation increased with a decrease in temperature. In the SmA* phase, only one relaxation mechanism was observed that behaves as soft mode. Two relaxation processes were detected in the SmC* phase. A high‐frequency relaxation process invariant at 2.2 kHz was due to a Goldstone mode, but the origin of low‐frequency relaxation process (1–20 Hz) is unclear; however, it may belong to an X‐mode. The dielectric spectrum of the SmCA* phase exhibits two absorption peaks separated by two decades of frequency. The low‐frequency peak is related to the antiferroelectric Goldstone mode, whereas the high‐frequency peak originates from the anti‐phase fluctuation of the directors in the anti‐tilt pairs of the SmCA* phase.},

To reduce the symmetry of the molecular systems, two ideas were successfully used; introductions of chirality and molecular shape asymmetry. The chirality introduced into rod-shaped and disc-shaped molecular systems led to chiral smectic C and chiral discotic columnar phases. Dogleg from rod and cone or bowl from disc in molecular shapes brought about polar organization by their packing, realizing so-called banana phases and polar columnar phases, respectively. Particularly, bent-core mesogens exhibit a variety of novel polar phases. In addition to such established polar structures, some evidences about polar structures realized in polar nematic and cholesteric phases are given in some detail. Attempts for the application of these polar liquid crystals such as displays are also overviewed.},

One of the compounds used has an unusually wide 59 K window for the B2 phase. The tilt angle was investigated as a function of temperature and found to be constant over this temperature range to within our resolution of 1°. The one-layer films studied exhibit the same structure as the thicker films, and have helped us to refine the optical model for the B2 phase. For thin films we find that modeling a single smectic layer as two uniaxial layers is a better description of the data than a single biaxial layer, but that for thick films the model used does not effect the simulated result appreciably. Preliminary results also find that the surface layers are less tilted than the interior layers, in contrast to rodlike liquid crystals, which show an enhanced surface tilt.},

	abstract = {The equations for the equilibrium of a thin elastic ribbon are derived by adapting the classical theory of thin elastic rods. Previously established ribbon models are extended to handle geodesic curvature, natural out-of-plane curvature, and a variable width. Both the case of a finite width (Wunderlich's model) and the limit of small width (Sadowksky's model) are recovered. The ribbon is assumed to remain developable as it deforms, and the direction of the generatrices is used as an internal variable. Internal constraints expressing inextensibility are identified. The equilibrium of the ribbon is found to be governed by an equation of equilibrium for the internal variable involving its second-gradient, by the classical Kirchhoff equations for thin rods, and by specific, thin-rod-like constitutive laws; this extends the results of Starostin and van der Heijden (2007) to a general ribbon model. Our equations are applicable in particular to ribbons having geodesic curvature, such as an annulus cut out in a piece of paper. Other examples of application are discussed. By making use of a material frame rather than the Fr{\textbackslash}'enet-Serret's frame, the present work unifies the description of thin ribbons and thin rods.},

	abstract = {Helical ribbons arise in many biological and engineered systems, often driven by anisotropic surface stress, residual strain, and geometric or elastic mismatch between layers of a laminated composite. A full mathematical analysis is developed to analytically predict the equilibrium deformed helical shape of an initially flat, straight ribbon, with prescribed magnitudes and orientations of the principal curvatures when subjected to arbitrary surface stress and/or internal residual strain distribution. The helix angle, radius, axis and chirality of the deformed helical ribbons are predicted with a comprehensive, three-dimensional model that incorporates elasticity, differential geometry, and variational principles. In general, the mechanical anisotropy (e.g., in surface/external stress, residual strain or elastic modulus) will lead to spontaneous, three-dimensional helical deformations. Ring shapes are formed when the principle axes of deformation coincide with the geometric axes of the ribbon. The transition from cylindrical helical ribbons to purely twisted ribbons, or tubular structures is controlled by tuning relevant geometric parameters. Analytic, closed-form predictions of the ribbon shapes are validated with simple, table-top experiments. This theoretical approach represent a tool to inform the design of materials and systems in order to achieve desired helical geometries on demand.},

Seitz in 1940, concentrated on simple crystals, with few atoms per cell, bonded together by strong ionic, covalent, or metallic bonds. References to weaker bonds, such as van der Waals forces in rare gases, or to geometric or chemical disorder (e.g., alloys or glasses) have been limited. The physical understanding of this ?eld started well before Seitz’s book and led to a number of Nobel prizes after the last war. Applications cover classical metallurgy, el- tronics, geology and building materials, as well as electrical and ionic transport, chemical reactivity, ferroelectricity and magnetism. But in parallel with this general and well publicized trend, and sometimes earlier as far as physical concepts were concerned, an exploration and increasingly systematic study of softer matter has developed through the twentieth century. More often in the hands of physical chemists and crystallographers than those of pure physicists, the ?eld had for a long time a reputation of complexity. If progress in polymers was steady but slow, interest in liquid crystals had lain dormant for forty years, after a bright start lasting through 1925, to be revived in the late 1960s based on their possible use in imaging techniques. The optoelectronic properties of the ?eld in general are even more recent.},

It explores the role of spatial dimensionality and microscopic interactions in determining the nature of phase transitions, as well as discussing the structure and properties of materials with different symmetries. Particular attention is given to critical phenomena and renormalization group methods. The properties of liquids, liquid crystals, quasicrystals, crystalline solids, magnetically ordered systems and amorphous solids are investigated in terms of their symmetry, generalised rigidity, hydrodynamics and topological defect structure.

It shows a novel sequence of four nontilted or orthogonal smectic phases on cooling: SmA-SmAP(R)-SmAP(X)-SmAP(A). Here SmAP(X) is the new orthogonal polar uniaxial smectic phase. The electric-field-induced transformations in the SmAP(X) phase give rise to two biaxial states separated by a uniaxial one. The second harmonic electro-optic response in this phase is interpreted in terms of the polar interaction with the electric field. A comparison of the experimental results with the next-nearest-neighbor model for the structure of the SmAP(X) phase shows it to be an SmAP(α) phase.},

How can one determine the growth laws that describe the time-dependence of characteristic length scales, and what can be said about the form of the associated scaling functions? Particular attention will be paid to systems described by more complicated order parameters than the simple scalars usually considered, e.g. vector and tensor fields. The latter are needed, for example, to describe phase ordering in nematic liquid crystals, on which there have been a number of recent experiments. The study of topological defects (domain walls, vortices, strings, monopoles) provides a unifying framework for discussing coarsening in these different systems.},

These disclinations are released in a controlled way, and the motion of the mutually repelling topological charges with strength +1 is studied quantitatively. We demonstrate that the classical models, which employ elastic one-constant approximation, fail to describe their dynamics correctly. In realistic liquid crystals, even small differences between splay and bend constants lead to the selection of pure splay or pure bend +1 defects. For those, the models work only in very special configurations. In general, additional director walls are involved which reinforce the repulsive interactions substantially.},

The computed evolution of the orientational correlation length and disclination density is found to be in agreement with previous experimental observations showing that disclination interactions dominate the coarsening process. The mechanism of smectic disclination movement, limited by the absorption and emission of elementary dislocations, is found to be facilitated by curvature walls connecting interacting disclinations. At intermediate times in the coarsening process, split-core dislocation formation and interactions displaying an effective disclination quadrupole configuration are observed. This work provides the framework for further understanding of the formation and dynamics of the diverse set of curvature defects observed in smectic liquid crystals and other layered material systems.},

	abstract = {Ordering phenomena that break certain symmetries often involve the dynamics of defects. In liquid crystals, such processes are easily visualized in polarized light microscopy. Point defect annihilation has been investigated experimentally and numerically in thermotropic nematics, lyotropics and active nematics. Free-standing smectic films are ideal model systems to probe two-dimensional hydrodynamics. Films in the smectic C phase represent the simplest anisotropic fluid in two dimensions. Within elastic one-constant approximation and neglect of hydrodynamic effects, the description of defect dynamics is identical to that of point charges in electrodynamics. Whereas the equations for two point charges are easily solvable analytically, the case of three or more charges is equivalent to the classical three-body problem. We present new methods to create defect pairs and groups of defects of topological strength +1 in a controlled way. The annihilation process, the repulsion of sets of +1 defects in several geometrical
configurations, and repulsion of +1 defects from larger positive net topological charges are analyzed. We discuss the influence of material flow and compare the experimental results to theory and simulations.

We compare our observations with a phenomenological model that includes dipole coupling of the director field to an external ordering field. This model is able to account for both the observed coalescence dynamics and the observed ordering dynamics. In the absence of an ordering field, our model predicts the defect density ρ to scale with time t as ρ lnρ∝t−1. When the dipole coupling of the director field to an external ordering field is included, both the model and experiments show the defect coarsening proceeds as ρ∝e−αt with the strain field confined to 2π walls. The external ordering field most likely arises from the director’s tendency to align with edge dislocations within the liquid-crystal film.},

Because the film is a 2- d elastic medium, low-frequency elastic oscillations occur in the ring pattern in the absence of shear.

Continuum-based models developed within the frameworks of elasticity theory, fluid dynamics and statistical mechanics provide a framework for studying membrane biophysics over a range of mesoscopic to macroscopic length and time regimes, but the application of such ideas to simulation studies has occurred only relatively recently. We review some of our efforts in this direction with emphasis on the dynamics in model membrane systems. Several examples are presented that highlight the prominent role of hydrodynamics in membrane dynamics and we argue that careful consideration of fluid dynamics is key to understanding membrane biophysics at the cellular scale.},

	abstract = {Much of the interest in bent-core compounds in the last few years has centred aroundtheir potential to form nematic liquid crystal phases, which may be both biaxial andpolar. These properties offer possibilities for nematic ferroelectric switching andnonlinear optics applications. In this work, two optical properties, the refractive indices and the second ordernonlinear optical response, were investigated in the high temperature ({\textgreater} 170 °C)nematic phase of a series of bent-core oxadiazole compounds, of varying chain typeand length. An experimental technique, based on the acquisition and analysis of reflectionspectra from liquid crystal cells, and capable of operating at the high temperaturesrequired, was used for the measurement of refractive indices. The extraordinaryrefractive index was found to range from 1.70 to 1.78 over the nematic phase of thebent-core compounds. The ordinary refractive index varied from 1.58 to 1.62. Bothranges of values are higher than is typically observed for rod-like liquid crystals. Thebirefringence took values from {\textasciitilde} 0.10, in the high temperature nematic phase, to{\textasciitilde} 0.18, close to the underlying smectic phase. A new experiment was designed, constructed and tested for the second harmonic(SH) measurements. The dependences of the SH on temperature and on scatteringangle are well explained by the theory of SH generation by the flexoelectricpolarisation induced by thermal fluctuations of the director in the nematic phase. Themaximum conversion efficiency was measured to be very low, {\textasciitilde} 1/10000 of apercent. No evidence for the formation of macroscopic biaxial nematic phases was found byeither the refractive indices or SH experiments. However, for the compounds havinglong nematic phases of {\textgreater} 50 °C, different regimes of behaviour in the uniaxialnematic phase were revealed by the SH experiments. This atypical behaviour isconsistent with other reports on these compounds. This study cannot confirm the existence of nanoscale cybotactic clusters in thenematic phases of the bent-core compounds examined but neither is it inconsistentwith them.},

	abstract = {The structural and electro-optic investigations of an achiral bent-core molecule in Sm AP A phase, in which the polar directors in the neighboring layers are arranged anti-ferroelectrically, show that it undergoes transformation from one biaxial to another biaxial structure via a quasi-stable uniaxial structure on the application of the electric field. The non-continuous change in biaxiality is explained by an intermediate state in which the secondary directors in the neighboring layers are perpendicular to each other.},

	abstract = {A polarization reorientation process has been studied by means of optical second-harmonic generation in an optically uniaxial smectic phase of an asymmetric bent-core liquid crystal. A nontilted polar smectic order with a biaxial order is induced by applying an electric field to the uniaxial nonpolar smectic phase. This phenomenon was well simulated by the two-dimensional Langevin process, i.e., electric-field-induced continuous molecular reorientation against thermal agitation. The simulation suggests that about 200s of molecules form a polar domain and cooperatively respond to the applied field. The existence of the polar domains and their reorientation are consistent to the dielectric measurement; a high dielectric constant of about 60 at the kHz range is markedly suppressed by applying a bias field.},
